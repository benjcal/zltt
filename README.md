## ZLTT 

This is a simple toy project to create a simple TUI (Text User Interface) for a smart kitchen.

SDL is used to render the GUI, Zig is used as glue language to interface with the C APIs, and Lua to operate the the app.

The Lua API is extremly simple but very versatile. Look at `examples/` for example functionality.
